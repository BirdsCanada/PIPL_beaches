```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

To Do:
-get a number for each beach that shows the amount of land within the buffer (exclude sea)
-finalize buffer size
-process landuse data
-reformat with physical data
-process survey data into format for analysis
-visualize


currently calculating a percentage of the 30km buffer, but should recalculate to show what portion of that is land, and then calculate a percentage based on that.
```{r landuse}

ggplot(beachPhys, aes(tot_area_km, color = landclass))+ geom_histogram()+facet_wrap(~landclass)



ggplot(beachPhys, aes(landclass, tot_area_km ))+ geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~region)

```
