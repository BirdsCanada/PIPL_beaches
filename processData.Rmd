```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

To Do:
-get a number for each beach that shows the amount of land within the buffer (exclude sea)
-finalize buffer size
-process landuse data
-reformat with physical data
-process survey data into format for analysis
-visualize


currently calculating a percentage of the 30km buffer, but should recalculate to show what portion of that is land, and then calculate a percentage based on that.
```{r landuse plots}
ggplot(beachPhys, aes(tot_area_km, color = landclass))+ geom_histogram()+facet_wrap(~landclass, scales = "free")

ggplot(beachPhys, aes(landclass, tot_area_km, colour = landclass))+ geom_boxplot()+facet_wrap(~Region)
```

```{r big dataset}
data<-inner_join(prodData, beachPhys, by = c('BeachID', 'Length_km', 'Region'))

ggplot(data, aes(x = Length_km, y= YE_pairs, color = Region))+geom_point()
```
