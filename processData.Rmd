```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

To Do:
-get a number for each beach that shows the amount of land within the buffer (exclude sea)
-finalize buffer size
-process landuse data
-reformat with physical data
-process survey data into format for analysis
-visualize


currently calculating a percentage of the 30km buffer, but should recalculate to show what portion of that is land, and then calculate a percentage based on that.
```{r landuse}
#calculate the area within the buffer of each beach that is used in the diff landuse categories
x<-landuse %>% 
  group_by(Name,landclass) %>% 
  summarize(Tot_area = sum(Int_Area), Tot_area_km = Tot_area/1000000, percentage = Tot_area_km/(pi*(30^2)))

ggplot(x)
```
